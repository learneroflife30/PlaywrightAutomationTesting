Playwright Notes

Playwright uses two selectors, CSS and Xpath to locate elements and we predominately use CSS selector in playwright.

if id is present 
css -> tagname#id (or) #id

if class attribute is present
css -> tagname.class (or) .class

write css based on any attribute
css -> [attribute = 'value']

using regular expression

css -> [attribute* = 'partial value'] note - using star with attribute.

write css with traversing from parent to child
css - > parenttagname >> childtagname

----

await is required when we are performing any action since javascript is asynchoronous.
eg - await terms.check();

----

***---important---***
in case of action being performed inside the bracket then we use await inside.
eg - expect(await terms.isChecked()).toBeTruthy();

----

how to know if await is needed is when test case fails with empty array, like this -> {}


waitfor() method is helpful in loading page ( dom ) content to fetch values to ensure empty array in not comming.

eg -   

await productname.last().waitFor(); // to ensure all elements are returned in array
console.log(await productname.allTextContents());
